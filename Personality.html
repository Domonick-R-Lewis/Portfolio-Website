        <h2>Personal Development: Twelve Pillars</h2>

      <div>
         <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
         <p>This inscription argues that while formal education makes a living, continuous personal development makes a fortune. To have more, you must first become more through constant learning and self-investment.</p>
          <p>Dedicate time each day to reading or learning a new skill, and invest a portion of your income in courses or books that help you grow.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
         <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
         <p>This pillar stresses the need to take full responsibility for your life, rejecting excuses and blame. It distinguishes between mere interest and true commitment, where commitment means accepting no excuses...Only results</p>
          <p>Catch yourself when you make excuses and reframe challenges by asking what you can do to change the outcome, honoring your commitments even when it's inconvenient.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
          <p>This chapter given teaches that a goal is a dream with a deadline, and that writing down your goals gives clear direction to your life. Without written goals, you risk wandering through life and fulfilling someone else's plans.</p>
            <p> Write down specific, measurable goals for your career, finances, and health, and review them daily to keep your focus and actions aligned.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
          <p>Using the ant as a model, this chapter advocates for a never-quit attitude and the discipline of planning ahead during good times. Ants also remain positive in hard times and consistently do all they possibly can without being told.</p>
            <p>Persist through setbacks by finding new approaches, save money for the future during times of plenty, and always put in maximum effort toward your goals.</p>
